# Port-Forwarding-Technique
1.We need to install an Xampp control panel for hsoting our website locally.
2.We also need to install the ngrok an open source program that allows us to securely port forward our localhost machine to the web.
  It allows us to easily test our web applications and APIs on different devices and networks without having to manually configure our routers.
3.Follow these steps for hosting the website accordingly:
 3.1 Launch XAMPP Panel 
 3.2 Start Apache and MySQL server in Xampp
 3.3 Allocation of ports by Xampp
 3.4 Open Terminal of NGROK and establish connection with the allocated port by XAMPP 
 3.5 Forwarding Link will be generated by NGROK
 3.6 Output can be tested using forwarding link in different systems.
